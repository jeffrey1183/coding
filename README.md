## Overview

現在學習程式很方便，網路上的免費和付費課程一大堆，只怕你看不完。我自己覺得有三個重點：

1. 你比較喜歡透過影片還是文字學習？
2. 學習的語言是？
3. 不用執著證照，重點是上完課你能寫出東西

像我自己後來發現我喜歡透過閱讀和問答的方式學習，像 Udacity、Teamtreehouse 或 Coursera 以影片為主的線上課程我很容易放棄，我比較喜歡 Programiz 和 MDN 以文字為主的課程。

## 開發前思考

在開始一個網站專案前

When starting with a web project, many people focus on the technical side. Of course you must be familiar with the technique of your craft, but what really matters is _what you want to accomplish_. Yes, it seems obvious, but too many projects fail not from a lack of technical know-how, but from lack of goals and vision.



So when you get an idea and want to turn it into a website, there are a few questions you should answer before anything else:

* What exactly do I want to accomplish?
* How will a website help me reach my goals?
* What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

[What exactly do I want to accomplish?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common\_questions/Thinking\_before\_coding#what\_exactly\_do\_i\_want\_to\_accomplish)

這是最重要的問題，列出所有你要達成的目標，可以是任何目標，例如販售商品賺錢、認識新朋友或跟音樂人一起演奏。

假設你是一名音樂人，你列出下面幾項

* Let people hear your music.
* Sell goodies.
* Meet other musicians.
* Talk about your music.
* Teach music through videos.
* Publish photos of your cats.
* Find a new girl/boyfriend.



列出來之後，你需要排優先度，從最重要到最不重要排序\


1. Find a new girl/boyfriend.
2. Let people hear your music.
3. Talk about your music.
4. Meet other musicians.
5. Sell goodies.
6. Teach music through videos.
7. Publish photos of your cats.



當你列出目標和分類，會幫助作決定，到底要不要做這個功能
